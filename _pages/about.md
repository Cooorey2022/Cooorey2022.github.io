# üî• About me 

Welcome to my home page! 

My name is Zedong Zhang, a junior researcher focuses on Robotics and AI. I currently work as a part-time research assistant at the National University of Singapore. I am seeking opportunities to continue my study as a Ph.D. candidate. My specific research interests include Robotics and Control, Medical Robots, Surgical Robots, AI, Reinforcement Learning, Life-long Learning, Non-parametric Learning, Offline RL, Human-Robot Collaboration, etc.

As for my education background, I graduated from [Chongqing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/) (project 985) with a B.Eng degree in Mechanical Engineering. In year 4, I participated in an exchange programme to study at the [National University of Singapore (Suzhou) Research Institute](http://en.nusri.cn/), where I completed my Final-Year-Project advised by [Prof. Zhang Yunfeng](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/zhang-yunfeng/). I received my M.Sc degree from the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg) in June 2022.

My research experience includes working at the [Centre for Smart Medical Technology of NUS research institute](http://en.nusri.cn/research/areas/amd/) supervised by [Prof. Ren Hongliang](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/bme/staff/dr-ren-hongliang/), during which period of time I participated in a National Key R&D project on Gastrointestinal Surgical Robot. After that, I have been working at the [NUS Advanced Robotics Centre](https://arc.nus.edu.sg/) supervised by [Prof. Ang Jr Marcelo](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/ang-jr-marcelo-h/), in the realm of AI and human-robot collaboration.

> ***Python, Deep Learning, Body Tracking*** 
>
> **Feb 2022 - June 2022**

- Uniform Crowd Environment was established in the Computer Vision Lab of Khalifa University. A large number of videos including people wearing the traditional uniforms of the middle east were shotted and collected. Annotations were done on the platform of [Computer Vision Annotation Tool(CVAT)]( https://cvat.org/). The conventional Deep Learning-based tracker **STARK** was implemented to track people in the uniform crowd. And the **refined tracker** adapted to the crowd environment was also implemented to track people and compared with the conventional tracker.
