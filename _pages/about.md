# 🔥 About me

Welcome to my personal page! 

My name is Zhibo Zhang (张志博), a graduate student of [Kalifa University](https://www.ku.ac.ae/), [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.ku.ac.ae/people-types/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/), majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I also work in this department as a research and teaching assistant with a full scholarship. Expecting to graduate in 2023.06 with a master’s degree, I am now trying to find opportunities to continue my career as a Ph.D. student. My research interests include cyber security, deep learning, trustworthy AI, and the intersection between computer security & explainable AI (XAI).

I graduated from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/) with a bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Engineering with honor. During my final year of my bachelor, I studied at the [National University of Singapore Suzhou Institute](http://en.nusri.cn/) as an exchange student. And I finished my Final Year of Project advised by [Dr. Peter C. Y. Chen](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/chen-chao-yu-peter/) there.

I am now doing research under the guidance of [Prof. Ernesto Damiani](https://www.ku.ac.ae/academics/college-of-engineering/department/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/people/prof-ernesto-damiani), [Dr. Chan Yeob Yeun](https://www.ku.ac.ae/academics/college-of-engineering/department/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/people/dr-chan-yeob-yeun), [Dr. Hussam Al Hamadi](https://www.ku.ac.ae/college-people/dr-hussam-al-hammadi), and [Dr. Fatma Taher](https://www.zu.ac.ae/main/en/colleges/colleges/__college_of_technological_innovation/faculty_and_staff/_profiles/Fatma_Taher.aspx) at [Center for Cyber-Physical Systems (C2PS)](https://www.ku.ac.ae/c2ps). I am now working in areas about spam filtering using explainable AI.

⌨ Projects
========

###  **Modeling of Human Navigation Behavior Using Reinforcement Learning**        

> ***Python, Reinforcement Learning***       
>
> **Oct 2020 - May 2021**

***

-    Simple modeling of human behavior reacting to **moving obstacles** in an indoor environment.

-    The original video was gained from **Suzhou Center Mall** and the annotations were done in [Computer Vision Annotation Tool(CVAT)]( https://cvat.org/).
-   **Q-Learning** algorithm of **Reinforcement Learning** was utilized to model target human’s behavior.

***

###  **Suspicious Spam Filtering Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence**        

> ***Python, LIME, SHAP*** 
>
> **Feb 2022 - May 2023(expected)**

- Realize the filtering of suspicious spam messages in Internet using **explainable AI**. Different Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms including **CNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest** would be deployed whereas explainable approaches including **LIME** and **SHAP** would be utilized to provide good explanations for generated decisions.

***

###  **Person Monitoring by Full Body Tracking in Uniform Crowd Environment**        

> ***Python, Deep Learning, Body Tracking*** 
>
> **Feb 2022 - June 2022**

- Uniform Crowd Environment was established in the Computer Vision Lab of Khalifa University. A large number of videos including people wearing the traditional uniforms of the middle east were shotted and collected. Annotations were done on the platform of [Computer Vision Annotation Tool(CVAT)]( https://cvat.org/). The conventional Deep Learning-based tracker **STARK** was implemented to track people in the uniform crowd. And the **refined tracker** adapted to the crowd environment was also implemented to track people and compared with the conventional tracker.
