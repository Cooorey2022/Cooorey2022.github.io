Modeling, Analysis and Control of a Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgical Robot with Tunable Stiffness

Abstract— Gastrointestinal endoscopic surgery (GES) can be performed more accurately and safely by utilizing a dexterous and variable-stiffness instrument. 
In this work, we develop a cable-driven gastrointestinal endoscopic surgical robot, called GESR, with a novel tunable stiffness mechanism. The GESR system 
consists of a cable-driven manipulator with tunable stiffness mechanism, a transmission with tendon-sheath mechanism and a compact driver with modular
design. The kinematics and stiffness mechanism are modeled in detail. To solve the stiffnessrelative hysteresis in practice, we propose a novel stiffnessdep-
endent modified generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii (MGPI) model to establish the real input-output relationship, and design a control strategy based on the MGPI
model. In experiments, we firstly apply the above models in real robot control, which improves the control accuracy significantly. Then, we test the dynamic 
response and positioning repeatability of the manipulator at different stiffness conditions to prove the feasibility of the tunable stiffness mechanism.
